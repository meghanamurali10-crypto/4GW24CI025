# REAL CIRCLE
# Student Connection App - UI/UX Design

## The Problem
College students struggle to find real community beyond their immediate friend circles. Current social platforms promote passive scrolling and superficial interactions instead of genuine connections.

## Our Solution
A mobile app that helps students build meaningful friendships through themed journeys, real-world challenges, and shared experiences—not just likes and follows.

## Key Features

### 2. AI-Driven Social Prompts
Smart suggestions that help students start real conversations and plan meetups.

### 3. Interactive Micro-Challenges
Small, fun activities that encourage students to connect in person and create memories together.

### 4. Digital Scrapbook
A dynamic way to capture and share moments from real-life experiences with new friends.

### 5. Privacy-First Design
- Consent-based visibility controls
