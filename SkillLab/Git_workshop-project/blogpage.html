	<body> <h1> Be Independent  </h1>
	<img src = "blogimage.jpg">
   
	  <p> A woman who supports herself on her own entirely and is proud to be able to do so could be seen as being independent. 
	An independent woman knows what she feels, says what she really believes, and lives true to her own values. 
	She owns her own power and looks out for herself.Being independent in everything ; I think that's the most important thing 
	in life. Find a sense of self. With that, you can do anything else. We need women who are so strong they can be gentle, 
	so educated they can be humble, so fierce they can be compassionate, so passionate they can be rational, and so disciplined 
	they can be free.They want women to sit back in the house, looking after the kids and to give up whole of their career. 
	They expect them to look after the in-law parents, staying back at the house.</p>
	      <p> It really hurts to say that it is still the same scenario over the years here, in this society! 
    To get married, have kids, do the household chores.....do they think these are the eternal  purpose of life ? We can 
	see many women around us who had to give up their careers and dreams just because they 'had to' get married.Let everyone 
	attain their own success. Let them achieve their own happiness. Let everyone be independent. Try to stand with them 
	and support them. If not, stay out of their way.
           Wishing you all to have a good day.	</p>
