A woman who supports herself on her own entirely and is proud to be able to do so could be seen as being independent. An independent woman knows what she feels, says what she really believes, and lives true to her own values. She owns her own power and looks out for herself.

Being independent in everything ; I think that's the most important thing in life. Find a sense of self. With that, you can do anything else. We need women who are so strong they can be gentle, so educated they can be humble, so fierce they can be compassionate, so passionate they can be rational, and so disciplined they can be free.
